## Make CSS proud to be American

Take 10 minutes to do this:

Feel free to work with someone.

"But Robin, I don't know how!"

Well, what might you Google?

### In retrospect

...you should probably never actually make artwork in CSS. As you saw in the SASS lesson, [people *do*](http://www.bypeople.com/50-impressive-css-drawings/), but it's much more just for kicks than for any practical purpose.

how does the above exercise tie into your lesson? Would like to see a softer transition / fleshed out a little more

## Pseudo-selectors

`:nth-child()` is one. More specifically, it's a pseudo-*class*.

#### What does "pseudo" mean?

It's Latin (or Greek or something) for "false". `:nth-child()` is a "false class" because it doesn't really select an element; it selects a specific *state* of an element.

Pseudo-selectors all start with a colon. So if I wanted to select every `div` that was the 4th child of its parent, I'd write `div:nth-child(4)`.

#### What other pseudo-selectors have you seen?

...augmented by the pseudo-selectors I've seen.

##### Pseudo-classes
- `:hover`
- `:visited`
- `:active`
- `:disabled`
- `:checked`
- `:focus`
- `:target`
- `:empty`
- `:not`


- `:first-letter`
- `:first-line`
- `:first-of-type`
- `:last-of-type`
- `:only-of-type`
- `:nth-of-type`
- `:nth-of-last-type`
- `:first-child`
- `:last-child`
- `:only-child`
- `:nth-child`
- `:nth-of-last-child`

maybe a you-do scavenger hunt here? break up into groups, research and demo within 5 mins.


##### pseudo-elements
- `:after`
- `:before`

You can treat pseudo-selectors just like any other selector in that you can chain them together:

#### What does this select, in English?

`nav a:nth-of-type(odd):active`

> "Inside every `nav`, select every odd-numbered anchor that is currently being clicked upon."

### You can select any multiples of elements

`tr:nth-of-type(3n+3)`

This will select every 3rd row. How? `n` represents the element's number of its particular type. For example:

maybe point out here that before pseudo selectors were common, we had to use jQuery to do this sort of thing.

```html
<tr><!-- I'm the 0th of my type. (3 * 0) + 3 is 3, so instead of me being selected, the 3rd <tr> is selected--></tr>
<tr><!-- I'm the 1st of my type. (3 * 1) + 3 is 6, so instead of me being selected, the 6th <tr> is selected--></tr>
<tr><!-- I'm the 2nd of my type. (3 * 2) + 3 is 9, so the 9th <tr> is selected... but it doesn't exist, so nothing happens.--></tr>
<tr></tr>
<tr></tr>
<tr></tr>
```

## Forms

HTML checkboxes and radio buttons are virtually impossible to style, just because of the way browsers are built.

### Radio buttons

It's easy to make your own with CSS using `this+that`, which indicates "any `that` preceded immediately by a `this`":

```html
<input type="radio" name="country" value="USA" id="countryUSA" /><label for="countryUSA">USA</label>

<input type="radio" name="country" value="UK" id="countryUK" /><label for="countryUK">Britain</label>

<input type="radio" name="country" value="USSR" id="countryUSSR" /><label for="countryUSSR">Mother Russia</label>
```

```css
input[type=radio]{
  width:1px;
  height:1px;
  overflow:hidden;
  position:absolute;
  opacity:0.01;
}
input[type=radio]+label{
  display:block;
  background-color:#eee;
  color:#369;
}
input[type=radio]:checked+label{
  background-color:#369;
  color:#eee;
}
```

Why go to all that trouble on the radio button?

I'd use `display:none`, but in some (dumb) browsers, display:none means the element isn't included in form submissions.
whoah, didn't know that! 

### Drop-downs

HTML has drop-down menus built-in...

```html
<select name="country">
  <option value="USA">USA</option>
  <option value="UK">Britain</option>
  <option value="USSR">Mother Russsia</option>
</select>
```

...but they're ugly, and virtually impossible to style. You can make your own in the same way as your custom labels above.

The HTML is a bunch of radio buttons with labels, but you can use CSS to make them appear like a drop-down. It's still semantically valid, AND it looks great!

```html
<div class="dropdown">
  <a href="#">Select a country</a>
  <div>
    <input type="radio" name="country" value="USA" id="countryUSA" /><label for="countryUSA">USA</label>

    <input type="radio" name="country" value="UK" id="countryUK" /><label for="countryUK">Britain</label>

    <input type="radio" name="country" value="USSR" id="countryUSSR" /><label for="countryUSSR">Mother Russia</label>
  </div>
</div>
```

```css
.dropdown input[type=radio]{
  width:1px;
  height:1px;
  overflow:hidden;
  position:absolute;
  opacity:0.01;
}
.dropdown input[type=radio] + label{
  display:block;
  background-color:#eee;
  color:#369;
}
.dropdown input[type=radio]:hover + label{
  background-color:#369;
  color:#eee;
}
.dropdown a + div{
  display:none;
}
.dropdown a:hover + div{
  display:block;
}
```

might be a good place for a you do, like - https://github.com/ga-dc/moonrise_kingdom

## Pagination

We've used some Javascript to make single-page apps appear to have multiple views. But you can do the same thing with the `:target` selector in CSS.

You've probably seen URLs like this:

```
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11227809/why-is-processing-a-sorted-array-faster-than-an-unsorted-array/17782979#17782979
or any example that demos it
```

The `#` at the end indicates an anchor (or jump-tag, or jump-to). The browser is going to look for an element with the ID of `aboutMe`, and if it exists, it'll try to scroll to that element such that it's aligned with the top of the screen. If you click on a jump-tag referencing an element on the current page, it will *not* reload the page. This is handy for jumping around sections. (See any Github readme.)

The element indicated by the jump-tag is then considered "targeted", meaning we can select it with `:target`.

*This* means we can do stuff like show only the element that has been targeted, creating the illusion of having separate pages.

```html
<nav>
  <a href="#aboutMe">About me</a>
  <a href="#contact">Contact</a>
</nav>

<section id="aboutMe">
  <h2>About me</h2>
</section>

<section id="contact">
  <h2>Contact</h2>
</section>
```

```css
section{
  display:none;
}
section:target{
  display:block;
}
```

## Pseudo-selector translation

With the person at your table, write out *in English* what each of the following is selecting:

- `*:first-letter:after`
- `input:checked+label:hover`
- `input:not([type=text]):disabled`
- `p:last-of-type:after`
- `div:nth-of-last-type(3n+3)+*:hover`
- `input.title:focus+div`
- `a.button.delete:hover:after`
- `button.active.edit#update`
  - What's "wrong" with this selector?

## Continue working on your portfolio page

Try using a pseudo class or pseudo element to style the first letter or build a fancy
navigation menu that behaves like radio buttons.

If you're certain you don't have more you'd like to add to it, let your instructor know!

## (For those letting the instructor know)

**Write an exercise** for a future WDI student learning pseudo-selectors:

1. Create a "hook". What's the scenario? Maybe a shopkeeper in Legend of Zelda needs a website? Maybe the student has been tasked with refactoring the code for a crusty old Geocities page and making it HTML5/CSS3-compliant?
- Create starter code. This should be enough that students have an idea of where to start. If there's a lot of "busywork" that they need to do (e.g. doing `npm init` or `bower install bootstrap-sass`) maybe do that for them.
- Create a `readme.md` file. Anticipate questions students may have about the prompt and try to address those.
- Push it to **your** Github. Share your exercise with `/r/web_design` or `/r/programming`!
cool you-do!

Overall, lesson plan looks good!
I recommend revisiting the clearfix w/ pseudo elements
also here's a blog post I wrote with some cool applications - https://jesse.sh/practical-pseudo-elements-classes/
I recommend getting the students more involved when possible, and throwing in an exercise or two
to practice throughout the day.
