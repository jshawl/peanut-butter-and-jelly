## Do You Test? (5 / 5)

**THINK-PAIR-SHARE**: Weâ€™ve already seen how to work with tests in ruby. To get us back in that mindset, spend the next few minutes to think-pair-share on:

* Why test?
* Why not test?
* What problem does testing solve?

For those of you who answered no, why not?
* **Time.** It's a waste of my time and effort to test.
* **It's too much.** I can test just fine using the console.
* **App complexity.** My app is too simple to require testing.

Why should we?
* **Bug detection.** Quickly identify unanticipated errors.
* **Code Quality.** Create standards for our code before writing it.
* **Time.** Shorten development time through bug detection.
* **Documentation.** Tests act as a documentation of sorts for how our code should work. Helpful to other developers and shareholders.
* **Jobs.** Testing is a job requirement across the board.

## Everybody Does It (5 / 10)
ha nice headline

Testing is essential when working on large, complex projects.
* Take Ember.js for example. [If you look at the framework's repo](https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js#how-to-run-unit-tests), it comes packaged with a ton of tests.
* So many moving parts. And so many people contributing to them. Can you imagine how crazy this would get without testing?
maybe include some stats here incase the live demo doesn't go as planned.
e.g. it took 3.8 minutes to run 3,941 tests. This tests 943 files from 2031 contributors. 
i made up this info but would be nice to see!

## Test-Driven Development

### The Process (5 / 15)

Testing gives us more control over our code.
* We anticipate our errors with tests.
* We can't move forward with faulty code because these tests must pass.

![tdd flowchart](img/tdd-flowchart.png)

TDD step by step.
  1. **Think.** What do we want our code to do?
  2. **Write a test.** This test must fail. Why?
  3. **Run your test.** Seeing red.
  4. **Write code.** How can we make this test pass?
  5. **Test passes.** Green light.
  6. **Refactor and Repeat.**

red, green, refactor

### Unit Testing (5 / 20)

We've already encountered TDD once with RSpec. What's RSpec?
* Ruby framework.
* Domain-specific language (DSL) for testing Ruby code.
* We didn't get around to it in class but it can integrate with Rails.

In RSpec, we engaged in "Unit Testing."
* A way to test the most basic component of a program.

Here's a sample from Matt's lesson, in which we tested the functionality of a Person class.
* In particular the Person class' constructor method.
* In a Unit test we can test any facet of a person.
  * In can be a property (e.g., does this person have a name?)
  * It can be a method (e.g., can this person talk?)

```ruby
# Let's test the Person class.
describe Person do

  # Specifically, let's test its constructor method.
  describe "Constructor" do

    # Before each test, let's create and store a Person instance in @matt.
    before(:each) do
      @matt = Person.new("Matt")
    end

    # Test 1: @matt should be an instance of Person.
    it "should create a new instance of class Person" do
      expect(@matt).to be_an_instance_of(Person)
    end

    # Test 2: @matt should have a name.
    it "should have a name" do
      expect(@matt.name).to_not be_nil
    end
  end
end
```

## Jasmine

Today we're diving into the world of Javascript testing.
* One JS testing framework is Jasmine.
  * Not the only one. There's Mocha, QUnit and more...
  ^^ can you provide links to these in case people want to explore?
* It bills itself as a "Behavior Driven Development" framework...

## Behavior-Driven Development (5 / 25)

What does "Behavior Driven Development" mean and how is it different from TDD?
* TDD tells us how we should test. BDD informs which tests we should be running.
  * What is the purpose of your application? What are your user stories?
  * Make sure that your tests reflect the direction and purpose of your application.
  * BDD is less concerned with the granularity of your tests and more with whether they test the key functionality of your application.
* BDD is not defined by what functions or keywords you use to test your code.
  * It's a process to simplify and refine the number of tests you are running.
* We've already started implementing it.
  * Verbose test descriptions. Can be read in plain English.
  * In today's in-class example, we'll be creating a basic Calculator application and testing its key features.

## Meet Jasmine (10 / 35)

Here's a sample Jasmine test from their [documentation](http://jasmine.github.io/2.1/introduction.html)...

```js
describe("A suite is just a function", function() {
  var a;

  it("and so is a spec", function() {
    a = true;

    expect(a).toBe(true);
  });
});
```

Does any of it look familiar?
* What similarities does it have with RSpec?
  * `describe`, `it`, `expect`
  * Fortunately, we get to work with the same testing syntax as we do in Ruby.
* Look at them side-by-side...

![ruby js test side by side](img/ruby-js-side-by-side.png)

images are helpful! gonna do more of this in my lesson

Ruby aside, does this Jasmine test remind you of anything from WDI weeks 1-2?
* Getting some strong callback vibes from this...
* That's because `describe`, `beforeEach` and `it` are just functions!

Let's break down the format of a test.
* No need to code along here. We'll make our own tests later in this class.

**1. Suite**

```js
describe( "A person", function(){
  // Specs go here.
});
```

A "suite" is the highest-level container in our test file.
* A suite defines what we are testing. Oftentimes, this is an object.
* Indicated using the `describe` function.
* Takes two arguments: (1) a string, (2) a function
  * (1) The string is the name of what we are testing
  * (2) The function contains the actual tests

```js
describe( "A person", function(){
  // Specs go here.
});
```

**2. Spec**

```js
describe( "A person", function(){

  it( "should be named Adrian", function(){
    // Expectations go here.
  });

  it( "should be 28 years old", function(){
    // Expectations go here.
  });
});
```

In the "spec," we target a specific part of the suite.
* In the above example, we test to see if this person is named Adrian and is 28 years old.

**3. Expectations**

```js
describe( "A person", function(){

  it( "is named Adrian", function(){
    var person = { name: "Adrian", age: 28 };
    var name = person.name;
    expect( name ).toBe( "Adrian" );
  });

  it( "should be 28 years old", function(){
    var person = { name: "Adrian", age: 28 };
    see how ^^ is repeated? this is a good candidate for beforeEach as you mentioned in your todo.
    var age = person.age;
    expect( age ).toBe( 28 );
  });
});
```

Expectations are the meat-and-potatoes of our tests.
* Begins with code content. In this case, saves the name of the person in question to a variable.
* Last line is the actual expectation.
  * Begins with `expect`. Takes one argument, the variable whose value we are testing.
  * Followed by a **matcher** (e.g., `toBe`), which tests the expectation in a particular way.
    * `toBe` isn't Jasmine's only matcher. Along with equality you can check for greater/less than, null and more.
    * A full list of Jasmine's native matchers can be found [here](http://jasmine.github.io/edge/introduction.html#section-Expectations).
    * If you're feeling adventurous, you can even [create your own custom matcher](http://jasmine.github.io/2.0/custom_matcher.html).

**4. Refactor**

Could we make our tests here DRYer?
* We instantiate the `person` variable twice. Is there a function available that will let us do this once?

```js
describe( "A person", function(){

  oh nice!
  beforeEach( function(){
    var person = {
      name: "Adrian",
      age: 28
    };
  });

  it( "is named Adrian", function(){
    var name = person.name;
    expect( name ).toBe( "Adrian" );
  });

  it( "should be 28 years old", function(){
    var age = person.age;
    expect( age ).toBe( 28 );
  });
});
```

## Getting Started

First, we're going to install jasmine-node globally.

wait, node? does it matter? are there differences between front end testing and back end testing w/ js?
can you link to any articles on testint js opinions or "state of the industry" type things?

* `$ npm install  -g jasmine-node`
* Now we can use Jasmine across projects.

## What are we going to test?

During this lesson we are going to write tests for and create a calculator application.
* We're going to stick with Javascript here. No HTML/CSS at the moment.
* This will involve some Node syntax beyond what you've already seen.

## Let's get to work (20 / 55)

### Create your JS files.

Switch into your in-class folder and create the following.
make a directory first?
* Our calculator: `$ touch calculator.js`
* Our test folder: `$ mkdir spec`
* Our test file: `$ touch spec/calculator-spec.js`

actually, is there a repo for this? would be nice to reuse in the future
as well as have a solution students can reference

### Create our first test.

Before we write any of our calculator code, we're going to create a test.
* Let's start simple and create a test for our calculator's add functionality.
* But first, let's prepare our spec file so that it can actually test our calculator.

```js
// spec/calculator-spec.js

// Not unlike Ruby, `require` lets us reference `calculator.js` in our spec file.
// Now, any functions defined in calculator.js can be referenced using the format `calculator.functionName`.

var calculator = require( "../calculator" )
```

Let's break this test down according to its parts. First, **the suite**.
* What should our suite look like?

```js
var calculator = require( "../calculator" )

describe( "addition", function(){
  // Tests for our addition function will go in here.
});
```

Next up, let's make **a spec**.
* Let's test if our addition function can add 2 and 2 together.
* What should our spec look like?

```js
var calculator = require( "../calculator" )

describe( "addition", function(){
  it( "should add 2 and 2", function(){
    // Expectations go in here.
  })
});
```

And finally, let's create **the expectations** for our test.
* What should our add function look like?

```js
var calculator = require( "../calculator" )

describe( "addition", function(){
  it( "should add 2 and 2", function(){
    // Let's store the sum of our addition function.
    // Because our add function will be stored in calculator.js, we can reference it as such...
    var sum = calculator.add( 2, 2 );

    // Now what do we expect that sum to be?
    expect( sum ).toBe( 4 );
  })
});
```

That looks like a good test to me. Let's run it!
* From your in-class folder, run: `$ jasmine-node spec`
* What error do we get?

![failed add test](img/failed-add-test.png)

Of course, it failed. Let's create that addition function.

```js
// calculator.js

exports.add = function(){
weve been using module.exports so far. be prepared to answer "what is the diff btwn module.exports and exports?"

}
```

`exports`? What's that?
* With `exports` we can, well, "export" `add` or any other function in `calculator.js` to another javascript file.
  * Say we had an `accounting.js` file. We could give it full calculator functionality by `require`ing `calculator.js`.

Moving on. Let's fill out our `add` function.

```js
exports.add = function( addend1, addend2 ){
  return ( addend1 + addend2 );
};
```

Let's run our test again.

![passed add test](img/passed-add-test.png)

### We Do: Let's do the same for subtract. (5 / 60)
* Create the test - run your test - create the function - run your test.
* Bonus: write a test for squaring a number

## Object-Oriented Javascript (5 / 65)

You've already spent some time this week stepping up your OOJS game.
* So you might be wondering why we're exporting our calculator methods individually.
* Let's reformat our calculator to reflect a Javascript object and "export that" to our spec file.
* How do we go about doing that?
  * `module.exports`! Help me set that up.
* Won't require any changes to our tests. Just `calculator.js`.
  * Why is that?

```js
// calculator.js

// Think of `module.exports` as a collection of `exports.functionName`'s.
// oooo...
// Here it's set to an object that contains all of our calculator functionality.
// Imagine that `module.exports` was replaced with `var calculator`.

module.exports = {
  add: function( addend1, addend2 ){
    return ( addend1 + addend2 );
  },

  subtract: function( minuend, subtrahend ){
    return ( minuend - subtrahend );
  },

  // The rest of your calculator methods go here.
}
// should we use a constructor function here to reflect recent knowledge on OOJS?
```

## Break (10 / 75)

## Exercise: Build Out Our Calculator (15 / 90)

Follow the same process and add some functionality to our calculator.
  1. Multiplication
  2. Division
  3. Square
  4. Exponential
  5. Average

### Bonus
Implement `beforeEach`.  

Test and add some advanced functionality.
* Factorial - can you link to relevant wikipedia pages for more explanation/direction?
* Logarithmic

Test for error messages when your calculator makes an invalid operation.
* For example, test to make sure that your calculator returns a helpful error message when it tries to divide by 0.

## Exercise (Cont.): Add Some Matchers (10 / 100)

here feels like the best place to mention an async test. I recommend using settimeout,
but if it feels forced here, i say leave it out.

We've already played around with one matcher in our test expectations: `.toBe( )`
* Implement the following functions using the indicated matchers...
  * `.isNegative`: use `.not.` to check whether an input is negative. If it is, the expectation should return true.
  * `.isGreaterThan`: use `.toBeGreaterThan()` to check whether the first of two arguments is greater than the second. If it is, the expectation should return true.
* Need help? Look at the [Jasmine Documentation](http://jasmine.github.io/2.0/introduction.html#section-Matchers).

[Here's the calculator solution](https://github.com/ga-dc/jasmine-calculator) in case you need some guidance.
oh nice, maybe point this out earlier?

### Bonus

* `.isEven`: use `.toMatch()` to check if a value is even.
  * **Hint:** requires Regex
* [Create your own custom matcher](http://jasmine.github.io/2.0/custom_matcher.html).

## Break (10 / 110)

## Exercise + Homework: Clock Hands (30 / 140)

With the remaining time in class I'd like you to create this [Clock Hands angle calculator](https://github.com/ga-dc/sundial) using a TDD approach.
* Combine problem solving with TDD.
* There is no single way to do this, so feel free to create whatever tests you would like.
* While you're together, I encourage you to tackle this exercise pair-programming style.
  * First, outline the problem. Think about not only how to approach it but what tests you will need to support it.
  * Keep switching off: have one person write a test and the other write the code to make it pass.
