* Create and render a React component in the browser.
* Nest React components.
* Modify the state of a React component through events.


# What is ReactJS?

### Some History (5 / 5)
The first thing most people hear about React is "Facebook uses it."
* Recently went open-source.

### ReactJS in the MVC (5 / 10)
This week you were introduced to the Javascript MVC model.
* **ReactJS only concerns our "Views".**
  * What does "view" mean in Javascript? Compared to Rails?
  * Visual representations of our models - not the entire page.
* ReactJS can coexist with Models and Controllers. The user can set those up however they see fit.
* ReactJS can also work with other front end frameworks.

# Housekeeping

Clone [this repo](https://github.com/ga-dc/react-inclass).
Maybe demo a solution here?
* Contains a simple Express server that we'll use in today's class.
* We need to include some React script files: `react.js` and `JSXTransformer.js`
  * Available as a download [here](http://facebook.github.io/react/downloads/react-0.11.2.zip).
  * Or available via CDNs [here](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/react/).


# Components

There's actually a lot going on w/ web components in the industry right now:

## Hello World: A Very Basic Component (10 / 20)

The basic unit you'll be working with in ReactJS is a component.
* What does a component look like? Let's start with a simple "Hello World" example.
* This is a little messy but we're going to write out our Javascript directly in our HTML file.

```js
<script type="text/jsx">
  /** @jsx React.DOM */

</script>
```

What the hell is JSX?
> JSX is a XML-like syntax extension to ECMAScript without any defined semantics.

maybe mention here that is is possible to use React w/ native js, but jsx makes it easier to think
about how our virtual dom will be structured

The purpose of JSX will be more apparent as we start building out our application.
* Just know for now that...
  * Our `script` tag needs a type of "text/jsx".
  * The content of `script` must begin with this pseudo-comment: `/** @jsx React.DOM */`

```js
var Hello = React.createClass({
  render: function(){
    return (
      <p>Hello world.</p>
    );
  }
})
```

What do we see here?
  1. `var Hello`
    * This is the component we're creating. In this example, we are creating a "Hello" component.
  2. `React.createClass`
    * This is the React library method we use to create our component definition.
    * Takes an object as an argument.
  3. `render`
    * Every component has, at minimum, a render method.
    * Generates a virtual DOM node that will be added to the actual DOM.
    * The contents of this node are defined in the method's return statement.
      * At the moment, this return value looks exactly like HTML. But it's not...

So we've created the template for our component. But how do we actually render it?

```js
var Hello = React.createClass({
  render: function(){
    return (
      <p>Hello world.</p>
    );
  }
})

// Many tutorials will use React.renderComponent, which has been phased out
// ^^ have you a source? a link to changelog would be cool
React.render(
  <Hello />,
  document.getElementById( "container" )
);
```

`React.render` takes the Virtual DOM node created by `.createClass` and adds it to the actual DOM.
wait what's a virtual dom? what does it do?
* Takes two arguments...
  1. The component.
  2. The DOM element we want to append it to.

What language is `<Hello />` written in? **JSX.**
* Similar to XML.
* JSX is an alternate syntax for Javascript.
  * React can actually be run without JSX.
  * When we say `<Hello />`, in plain Javascript we are actually saying `React.DOM.div( null, "Hello world.")`
    * Basically, a string of React methods that create a virtual DOM node.
    nice!

Let's see what this looks like in the browser console...
* [FIGURE THIS OUT]
does this make sense here? React is all about the view layer. What would you wanna see in the console?

## Hello World: A Little Dynamic (10 / 30)

Our `Hello` component isn't too helpful. Let's make it more interesting.
* Rather than simply display "Hello world", let's display a greeting to the user.
* How do we feed a name to our `Hello` component without hardcoding it into our render method?

```js
var Hello = React.createClass({
  render: function(){
    return (
      <p>Hello { this.props.name }</p>
    );
  }
});

React.render(
  <Hello name="Tony" />,
  document.getElementById( "container" )
)
```

In the above example, we replaced "world" with `{this.props.name}`  

What are `.props`?
* Properties.
* Immutable. These cannot be changed while your program is running.
* Passed in as attributes to the JSX element in our `.render` method.

We can create multiple properties for a component.

```js
var Hello = React.createClass({

  // render's return statement can only return one DOM element
  // You can, however, place multiple elements within the parent DOM element

  render: function(){
    return (
      <div>
        <p>Hello { this.props.name }.</p>
        <p>You are { this.props.age } years old.</p>
      </div>
    );
  }
});

React.render(
  <Hello name="Tony" age="21" />,
  document.getElementById( "container" )
)
```

## Exercise: A Blog Post (15 / 45)

Let's have some practice creating a React component for scratch. How about a blog post?
* Create a Post object / model that has the following properties:
  1. title
  2. author
  3. body
  4. comments
  using constructor functions
* Render these properties using a Post component.
* The HTML/CSS composition of your Post is up to you.

### Solution

```js
// Model / Constructor
var Post = function( info ){
  this.title = info.title;
  this.author = info.author;
  this.body = info.body;
  this.comments = info.comments;
}

// Create Post object
var post = new Post({
  title: "My First Post",
  author: "Adrian",
  body: "Check it out. This is the first post on my dope blog!",
  comments: [ "First!", "Second!", "This blog needs more animated gifs." ]
});

// oho wow, nice!

// Define component (PostView)
var PostView = React.createClass({
  render: function(){
    return (
      <div class="post">
        <h2>Hello {this.props.title}</h2>
        <h4>By {this.props.author}</h4>
        <p>{this.props.body}</p>
        <h3>Comments</h3>
          <p>{this.props.comment}</p>
      </div>
    );
  }
});

// Render component
React.render(
  <PostView
    title={post.title}
    author={post.author}
    body={post.body}
    comment={post.comments[0]}
    do you need quotes for each of these values? what if the {} value has a space in it?
  />,
  document.getElementById( "container" )
);
```

## Nested Components (5 / 50)

What problems did you encounter when trying to add multiple comments to your Post?
* It would be a pain to have to explicitly define every comment inside of `<PostView />`, especially if each comment itself had multiple properties.
* The solution? **Nested components**.

We can nest Comment components within a PostView component
* We create these comments the same way we did with posts: `.createClass` and `.render`
* Then we can reference a comment using `<Comment />` inside of PostView's render method.

## Exercise: Add Nested Comments To Blog (10 / 60)

1. Create a `CommentView` component in the same way we did for `PostView`.
* Your `CommentView` render method should render a `commentBody` property.

2. Amend your `PostView`'s render method so that its return value generates three `<CommentView />` elements.
* Make sure to pass in the comment body as an argument to each component.

### Solution

```js
var Post = function( info ){
  this.title = info.title;
  this.author = info.author;
  this.body = info.body;
  this.comments = info.comments;
}

var post = new Post({
  title: "My First Post",
  author: "Adrian",
  body: "Check it out. This is the first post on my dope blog!",
  comments: [ "First!", "Second!", "This blog sucks." ]
});

var PostView = React.createClass({
  render: function(){
    return (
      <div class="post">
        <h2>Hello {this.props.title}</h2>
        <h4>By {this.props.author}</h4>
        <p>{this.props.body}</p>
        <h3>Comments</h3>
          <CommentView commentBody={post.comments[0]}/>
	  im not sure but is there a way to render all comments? in one line?
	  https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/multiple-components.html#dynamic-children
          <CommentView commentBody={post.comments[1]}/>
          <CommentView commentBody={post.comments[2]}/>
      </div>
    );
  }
});

var CommentView = React.createClass({
  render: function(){
    return (
      <p>{this.props.commentBody}</p>
    );
  }
})

React.render(
  <PostView
    title={post.title}
    author={post.author}
    body={post.body}
  />,
  document.getElementById( "container" )
);
```

## Break (10 / 70)

## State (15 / 85)

We already went over properties.
* The thing about properties, is, you can't change them.
* What do we do about values that need to be changed after a component is rendered?
* That's where **state** comes in.

Values stored in a component's state are mutable attributes.
* Setting up and modifying state is not as straightforward as properties.
* We need to set up some methods. Lets revisit our old `Hello` example.
  * Let's incorporate a counter into our greeting.

```js
var Hello = React.createClass({

  // We need to define the initial values of our state using `getInitialState`.
  // It returns an object with the initial state values.
  getInitialState: function(){
    return {
      // We are passing in a new `count` property, which we will initialize in `React.render`
      counter: this.props.count
    }
  },

  render: function(){
    return (
      <div>
        <p>Hello { this.props.name }.</p>
        <p>You are { this.props.age } years old.</p>

        // We can reference state values just like props using `this.state.val`
        <p>It is {this.state.date}</p>
	// whats the difference between this.props and this.state?
      </div>
    );
  }
});

// NOTE: We initialize a count property below at 1.
React.render(
  <Hello name="Tony" age="21" count="1"/>,
  document.getElementById( "container" )
)
```

Ok, we set an initial state. But how do we go about changing it?
* We need to set up some sort of trigger event to change our counter.
* How about a button? Where should we initialize it?

```js
var Hello = React.createClass({

  getInitialState: function(){
    return {
      counter: this.props.count
    }
  },

  raiseCounter: function(){
    this.setState({
      counter: parseInt(this.state.counter) + 1
    })
  },

  render: function(){
    return (
      <div>
        <p>Hello { this.props.name }.</p>
        <p>You are { this.props.age } years old.</p>
        <p>I have said hello {this.state.counter} times.</p>
        <button onClick={ this.raiseCounter }>Again.</button>
      </div>
    );
  }
});

React.render(
  <Hello name="Tony" age="21" count="1"/>,
  document.getElementById( "container" )
)
```

Whenever we run `.setState`, our component "diff's" the current DOM, and compares the Virtual DOM node with the updated state to the current DOM.
* Only replaces the current DOM with parts that have changed.
  ^^ can you add this explanation above as well when you mention virtual dom?

## Exercise: Implement State (10 / 95)

Let's create a state for our earlier blog example. We want to be able to edit the body of our post.

1. Initialize a state for our PostView. It should save a value for post body.
2. Create a method inside your PostView component definition that sets state to a new value.
  * Keep it simple: have your method generate a prompt through which you can create a new PostView body.
3. Create a button that triggers the above function.

### Solution

I recommend taking the solution out of the readme, and linking to it: 
https://github.com/ga-dc/react-inclass
^^ noticed there's no solution branch. let me know if you want help!

```js
var Post = function( info ){
  this.title = info.title;
  this.author = info.author;
  this.body = info.body;
  this.comments = info.comments;
}

var post = new Post({
  title: "My First Post",
  author: "Adrian",
  body: "Check it out. This is the first post on my dope blog!",
  comments: [ "First!", "Second!", "This blog sucks." ]
});

var PostView = React.createClass({
  getInitialState: function(){
    return {
      body: this.props.body
    }
  },

  editPost: function(){
    var newBody = prompt( "What would you like your post to say?" );
    this.setState({
      body: newBody
    })
  },

  render: function(){
    return (
      <div class="post">
        <h2>Hello {this.props.title}</h2>
        <h4>By {this.props.author}</h4>
        <p>{this.state.body}</p>
        <button onClick={ this.editPost }>Edit Post</button>
        <h3>Comments</h3>
	  // should render however many comments there are
          <CommentView commentBody={post.comments[0]}/>
          <CommentView commentBody={post.comments[1]}/>
          <CommentView commentBody={post.comments[2]}/>
      </div>
    );
  }
});

var CommentView = React.createClass({
  render: function(){
    return (
      <p>{this.props.commentBody}</p>
    );
  }
})

React.render(
  <PostView
    title={post.title}
    author={post.author}
    body={post.body}
  />,
  document.getElementById( "container" )
);
```

## What's Next? (5 / 100)

## Questions / Closing (5 / 105)

Having learned the basics of React, what are some benefits to using it vs. a different framework or plain ol' Javascript?

# TO DO
* Is there a difference between the two renders?
  - whachu mean?
* Why don't you need to include the nested component in `React.render`?
 - the component has the nested component defined in it. 
 https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/multiple-components.html#children
* Can you only set a state value to a component property value?
  <SomeComponent someAttribute={this.state...?}>
* What is the obvious benefit(s) of React?
  - Clear HTML structure of rendered components.
  - Nicely compartmentalized properties via props and state.
  - Easily pass in values from model to view.
  - 2 way data-binding
* Is it okay if I sum up the magic of React using some 3rd party example in the end?
  - not sure what you mean.
  - maybe a demo of some performance thing?
* Time / possible to incorporate form into example?
 - this would be cool! maybe a bonus w/ external links?
 -
