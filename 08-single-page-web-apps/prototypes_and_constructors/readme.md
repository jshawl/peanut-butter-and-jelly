## Object Orientation

Hi! This is an object: `{}`. Now you're oriented.

![Bad joke](http://media.giphy.com/media/xn2BRZmrIJxmM/giphy.gif)

Objects in JavaScript are a bit different from the ones you are used to from
ruby, but many of the same object-oriented design principles you applied when
writing your rails apps can apply when writing front-end JavaScript.

What is the definition of an object? An object encapsulates related data and
behavior. Why might we want to do this? Object-oriented programming provides us
with opportunities to clean up our procedural code and model it more-closely to
the external world.

Suppose we were building a card game. We'd start by building a deck. What does
the deck of cards look like? Perhaps:

Maybe include just a little more framing here to indicate the why. i.e. we've been working
with backend js, but our front is getting complicated quickly.

```js
var deck = ["Ace of Spades", "2 of Diamonds", "Queen of Diamonds", ... ] // etc
```

To a reader, it's immediately obvious that we have a deck of cards. But, when we go to use our data structure, say in a game of high card, we notice a few problems.

```js
// does the Ace of Spades beat the 2 of Diamonds? How do we compare strings?
var card0 = deck[0]; //=> "Ace of Spades"
var card1 = deck[1]; //=> "2 of Diamonds"
if ( translate(card0) > translate(card1) ) {
  return "Player 1 wins!";
} else {
  return "Player 2 wins!";
}
```

excellent example! would like to see the word "interface" in here some where.

We've had to write a whole other global method just translate card faces into
numerical values for comparison. You can see how this code is *proecdural*: we
do things step by step, manually creating values as we go in order to accomplish
our work. Instead, we might have taken an object-oriented approch:

```js
var deck = [
  {
    face: "Ace of Spades",
    numValue: 14,
    suit: "Spades",
    value: "Ace",
    beat: function beat (otherCard) {
      this.numValue > otherCard.numValue ? true : false
    }
  },
  { ... }, ...] // etc
```

There is still a lot of repetition in our object code. We'll see how to take
care of this in a moment. But, for now, notice how our comparison code is much
simpler:

```js
deck[0].beat(deck[1]) ? "Player 1 wins!" : "Player 2 wins!"
```

The reason this is simpler is easy: we've encapsulated the comparison logic in
the card object itself, as well as each card's numerical value.

## Making Objects

So far, we've had to make our objects 'by hand', i.e. using object literals:

```js
var celica = {
  model: 'Toy-Yoda Celica',
  color: 'limegreen',
  fuel: 100,
  drive: function() {
    this.fuel--;
    return 'Vroom!';
  },
  refuel: function() {
    this.fuel = 100;
  }
}

var civic = {
  model: 'Honda Civic',
  color: 'lemonchiffon',
  fuel: 100,
  drive: function() {
    this.fuel--;
    return 'Vroom!';
  },
  refuel: function() {
    this.fuel = 100;
  }
}
```

Notice how much duplication there is in that code! Just imagine if we needed a
hundred cars in our app!!

As you may have noticed, some of these properties change between cars (model
and color), and others stay the same, for example, `fuel` starts at 100, and
`drive` and `refuel` are the same functions for every car.

Why don't we build a function that makes these objects for us!

### Exercise

Define a function: `makeCar()` that takes two parameters (model, color) and
makes a new object literal for a car using those params, and returns that object.

For example:
```js
// This should return a car object just like the previous example
var celica = makeCar("Toy-Yoda Celica", "limegreen");
```

See solution in `car.js`

## Constructor Functions

It's so common that we need to make objects with similar properties / methods
that programming languages usually have some features to help with this. In
Ruby, we have **classes** which can create **objects**, or **instances** of
that class.

Javascript doesn't really have classes, instead we use constructor functions and
prototypes to achieve similar results. (Note: the newest version, ES6, adds
classes, but they're really just syntactic sugar, behind the scenes it's still
using constructors and prototypes).

Constructor functions are a lot like the `makeCar` function we just created, but
they're supported by JS and we use the `new` keyword to use the constructor
function.

```js
function Person(initialName) { // point out why this is capitalized
  this.name = initialName;
  this.species = "Homo Sapiens";
  this.speak = function() {return "Hello! I'm " + this.name};
}

var adam = new Person("Adam");
var bob =  new Person("Bob");

adam.name // "Adam"
adam.speak() // "Hello! I'm Adam"

bob.name // "Bob"
bob.speak() // "Hello! I'm Bob"
```

Notice the use of `this`, and the fact that we don't return anything. Here's why
we write constructor functions this way:

When we run a constructor function with `new`, Javascript will automatically:

1. Create an new, empty object for us.
2. Call the constructor function on that object (this -> the new object)
3. Return the object

### Exercise: Car Constructor Function

Write a constructor function to replace our `makeCar` function earlier.

See car.js for a solution.

## Prototypes

There's one problem with our constructor function... every time we create a new
car, it's creating new copies of the `refuel` and `drive` functions. This isn't
really necessary, since those functions are exactly the same for every car.

Creating all these copies can cause our program to use more memory than it
really needs to.

Thankfully, by using **prototypes**, we can eliminate this duplication. Every
object in JS has a `prototype` property, that points to another **object**.
Almost always, the prototype of a given object will come from it's
**constructor** (which has a prototype).

Any properties / methods defined on an object's prototype are available on the
that object. An example:

```js
function Person(initialName) {
  this.name = initiaName;
}

Person.prototype.species = "Homo Sapiens";
Person.prototype.speak = function() { return "Hello! I'm " + this.name; }


// OR Alternate form:
// The disadvantage here is that we're overwriting any existing properties on
// the prototype
Person.prototype = {
  species = "Homo Sapiens",
  speak: function() {
    return "Hello! I'm " + this.name;
  }
}

// Our objects work just as they did before!
var adam = new Person("Adam");
var bob =  new Person("Bob");

adam.name // "Adam"
adam.speak() // "Hello! I'm Adam"

bob.name // "Bob"
bob.speak() // "Hello! I'm Bob"
```

### INSERT DIAGRAM HERE

To see an object's prototype, you can look at the `__proto__` property. It's
generally not a good idea to change the prototype directly by assigning to the
`__proto__` property.

what is the difference between __proto__ and prototype?

### Exercise: Car Constructor with Prototypes

Write a constructor function with prototypes for our cars.

See car.js for a solution.

## Exercise: Monkey

Insert link to monkey OOP exercise (same as ruby, but in JS, with TDD).

Can TDD be the same as Adrian's lesson re: Jasmine?
